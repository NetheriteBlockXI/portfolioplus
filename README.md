# User Portfolio Template

This template helps you set up a simple, customizable bio or portfolio website. Customize it with your personal details, projects, and links to create a unique portfolio!

## Customizing the Template

1. **Update Your Details**:
   - Change text like `YourUsername`, `User's Name`, `YourGitHubUsername`, and `YourDiscordUsername` to your information.

2. **Image Files**:
   - Replace images in the `img` folder (`avatar.png`, `discord.png`, `git.png`, `dw0.png`) with your own images.
   - Ensure that the image file names and paths match whatâ€™s referenced in `index.html`.

3. **Adding Projects**:
   - Add or duplicate `<div class="project">` sections in the `index.html` to showcase more projects.

## Notes

- For best results, make sure to use images that are optimized for the web.
- The template dynamically changes the background color as you scroll. You can adjust the effect by modifying the JavaScript code in the `<script>` section.
