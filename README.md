The following sections outline how to customize the text and images on your portfolio website.

#### Changing Text Content

1. **Open the `index.html` File**
   - Use a text editor (like Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, or any text editor of your choice) to open the `index.html` file.

2. **Edit Text Elements**
   - Locate the sections you want to modify. For example, to change your name or description, look for the following lines:
     ```html
     <h1>Your Name</h1>
     <p>Your description goes here.</p>
     ```
   - Update the text within the tags as needed.

#### Changing Images

1. **Image Files Location**
   - The template uses images stored in the `img/` directory. You will find placeholders like `avatar.png`, `dw0.png`, `git.png`, and `discord.png`.

2. **Replace Images**
   - To change an image:
     - **Delete the Placeholder Image:** Remove the existing image file from the `img/` directory.
     - **Add Your New Image:**
       - Save your new image in the `img/` folder. Ensure that the new image has the same name as the placeholder image or change the filename in the HTML accordingly.
     - **Update the HTML (if needed):**
       - If you change the name of the image, find the relevant `<img>` tag in `index.html` and update the `src` attribute to match the new filename:
         ```html
         <img src="img/your-new-image.png" alt="Description of the image">
         ```

#### Updating Links

1. **Modifying Links**
   - To update the links in the "Links" section, locate the following code block in `index.html`:
     ```html
     <div class="link-item"><a href="https://github.com/NetheriteBlockXI/" target="_blank">GitHub Profile</a></div>
     ```
   - Replace the URLs and link text as needed.
